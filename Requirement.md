# Create a very simple Laravel web application for task management:

1. Create task (info to save: task name, priority, timestamps)
2. Edit task
3. Delete task
4. Reorder tasks with drag and drop in the browser. Priority should automatically be updated based on this. #1 priority goes at top, #2 next down and so on.
5. Tasks should be saved to a mysql table.

BONUS POINT: add project functionality to the tasks. User should be able to select a project from a dropdown and only view tasks associated with that project.

_**You will be graded on how well-written & readable your code is, if it works, and if you did it the Laravel way.**_

**Include any instructions on how to set up & deploy the web application in your Readme.md file in the project directory (delete the default readme).**
